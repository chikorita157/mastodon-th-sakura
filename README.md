#  Mastodon Glitch+Treehouse Edition  #

> Now with bunny ears!

So here's the deal: we all work on this code, and anyone who uses that does so absolutely at their own risk. Can you dig it?

Specifically, this fork-of-a-fork is intended for Treehouse use only. Unless
otherwise communicated, we will not put effort into supporting other deployments
or upstreaming our patches. This repo might be messy. Cleanliness of Git history
is not guaranteed -- watch out for falling rebases regardless of A-button count!
