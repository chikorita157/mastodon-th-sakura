#  Mastodon Glitch+Treehouse Edition  #

> Now with bunny ears!

So here's the deal: we all work on this code, and anyone who uses that does so absolutely at their own risk. Can you dig it?

Specifically, this fork-of-a-fork is intended for Treehouse use only. Unless
otherwise communicated, we will not put effort into supporting other deployments
or upstreaming our patches.
